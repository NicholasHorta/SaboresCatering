### Project description:

This project was my initial foray into a horizontal web design, the concept intrigued me and I had recently been in contact with a family member who was considering starting a small catering company, I wanted to build a simple, straight forward site which just gave an idea of what the site would look like. I felt like challenging myself to implement a new design to practice and learn all while creating a small mock-up.

The final product visually, however, was not something I was very excited about it as it was tough to work with, especially in a responsive aspect. I made a 2.0 visual version in regard to the design, however, the responsiveness has not been implemented.

### What building this project taught me:

As this was the first horizontal project I created, it was a challenging project in regard to containing the elements on the page, ensuring overflow was handled correctly and responsive design was as smooth and appealing as possible.

This was also my first project in which I implemented SASS after having learnt it, it was an interesting and refreshing simultaneously as the capabilities SASS provides makes the process of creating and maintaining CSS much easier along with extended functionality.
